# Requirement
1. Python 2.7 or later
2. Access to internet

# Reference data source
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

# Objective
I used data from breast cancer histology to develop a model for breast cancer prediction. Then based on a subset of the variables, I was able to create a new tool (User interface) that prompts user to enter as much data as is available, and then predict the disease very accurately. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
# How to use
1. The first section attempted to build the model using both k-means and linear regression for predicting cancer malignancy
2. The second section selected 4 variables from the 31 variables used in the model and attempted to show that we still get accurate prediction  of malignancy using a subset of the models
3. This is very useful for missing data or when using equipment that do  not capture the entire range of data

# The tool
1. We build a work in progress tool that prompts user to input readings from data from an image, with limited number of information enough to predict the cancer malignancy.
2. User is prompted to enter as many data as needed at the prompt of the cursor with short instruction on expected data.
3. Once up to 4 o teh important variables have been provided, the tool will perform prediction internally and spit back the cancer classification.
